# ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Overview**

Welcome to Sanctuary of Sound Media Player designed and developed by Sione Yerkovich.

The inspiration of this application was derived from a mix of nostalgia and my inherent need to understand how most things function both inside and out. Nostalgia was drawn from my youth where family often used applications like Windows Media Player or Limewire 
to blast the latest in 90's & 2000's classics. 

There were only a few business rules that I had laid out prior to commencing this project:
1. Must contain an integrated database
2. Incorporate and adhere to CRUD application principles
3. Log-in menu's that validate user details against the database
4. A captcha system for registration
5. User friendly UI

Over time, these business rules were expanded upon; paving the way for more UI/UX features as i tested the application throughout development periods. 

# üöÄ **Tech Stack**

I built this site using the integrated design features of Winforms to an almost (see Future Scope below) fully functional Media Player as a way to display, test and improve my skillset with C# programming, SQL and the .NET framework.

I utilised ***.NET*** to build the overall skeleton of every component/page. EFcore for .NET was used for object-relational mapping while integrating the database; LINQ query was used to access and manipulate the data population. 

***C#*** programming logic was integrated to provide function to these pages, including the security of captcha and input validations.

***SQL*** allowed me to create the databases and implement them directly into the application to store user data. It also allowed me to create and manage admin accounts for the hypothetical scenario.

# üåü **Plans for Future Scope**

- Album cover art displayed based on the currently playing track
- Uploaded songs remain permanently uploaded per user
- Song titles display based on the currently playing track
- Functional forgotten password section
- Database hosting for functional app deployment. Deployed version currently does not operate without a dedicated server/database host and api gateway
- Allow users to delete their account (COMPLETED)

# üìñ **Challenges and/or learnings**

The biggest challenge i faced was during the deployment phase of this project, i found difficulty in finding a way to allow for remote installation while retaining the core feature of this application (Database integration). During my search for a solution, i learnt a plethora of useful information; including server & database hosting and API integration. This is a hurdle i have been unable to overcome as of yet.

Another challenge i found was the integration of legacy features that would allow my media player to operate as intended, as the documentation available was minimal and required further research. As a student developer you are often pushed to learn and use the latest technologies, this project has taught me that sometimes you can infact "learn from the old dog with old tricks". I'm humbled by my tenacity in this situation, which allowed me to overcome this obstacle.
